# Tutoring-Invoice-Management-System

This JavaScript project was designed to automate the creation of monthly tutoring invoices. In particular, using the Google Calendar API, all monthly tutoring sessions are collected and recorded. Then using those sessions a monthly PDF invoice per student is created using the pdfkit library. Finally, for each invoice an email is automatically sent to each studentâ€™s parent using Nodemailer library.
